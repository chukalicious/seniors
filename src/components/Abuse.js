            Elder abuse is on the rise in California. More than 200,000 older
            and dependent abuse cases are reported in California each year, and
            it is believed that abuse of older adults is significantly
            underreported.

            Blanca Castro, the state's Long-Term Care Ombudsman, shared ways to
            spot elder abuse and how you can advocate for loved ones. Types of
            abuse include self-neglect, neglect by others, physical abuse,
            mental abuse, sexual abuse, financial abuse, and abandonment.

            Castro explained how to determine whether your loved one might be a
            victim of abuse. "Use all five senses," she said. "Look around their
            room, smell them. Are they acting normal? Is any behavior out of the
            norm? There are signs that something could be happening."

            If something seems off, Castro urges family members to ask for a
            doctor's assessment. "It is crucial to make sure that they -those in
            long-term care facilities- are okay and taken care of, and know that
            you have a right to ensure that they are safe."
