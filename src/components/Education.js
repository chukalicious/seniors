            Through many hurdles in my life, I was able to achive this dream
            right here at CSUN. I did this at 84 years old. I am living proof
            that it is never too late to set a goal and reach it. I have done a
            lot in my life.

            In 1954 I was kicked out of school during my senior year. Following
            this, I took a break from my education. I decided to join the US
            Navy where I served for eight years and got my GED. After the
            service, I was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.{" "}

            In my 40s, I realized that getting a degree in psychology is
            something that I wanted to do in my life. I enjoyed psychology fir
            the reason of having way to explore inside my own head. I did other
            things for many years. I found success in acting, appearing in
            movies and commercials.{" "}

            After all this, I found myself at the doors of CSUN in my 80s. I was
            here to finally obtain the degree I wanted, and that is exactly wht
            I did. I won't deny that getting through school was a lot harder to
            do at this age compared to the past. However, I was able to get
            through it and form new friendships with fellow students who
            embraced me at CSUN along the way. I was as much of a student as
            they were.

            Now that the goal is accomplished, I do not ant to stop here. I want
            to continue my education in January. I appreciate my time here at
            CSUN and would like everyone to know that it is never too late to
            finish your education. There are a lot of former students and
            veterans out there who may feel that they missed their chance of
            achieving a college degree. I want to prove that if I can do it,
            anyone can. I want to help fellow CSUN students chase their dreams
            as well. The school helped me realize that dream.
