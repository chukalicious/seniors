                The plan acknowledges that "affordable aging" is becoming more
                difficult to find. Almost 30% of older Californians currently
                live in poverty, and more than 2 million older adults in
                California are economically insecure.

                While efforts to create the plan began prior to the pandemic,
                the onset of COVID-19 emphasized the urgency of developing a
                plan to address aging. In his letter on the Master Plan for
                Aging, Newsom said the outbreak “exposed persistent and systemic
                inequities” in the state, and strained aging and disability
                services “like never before”.

                About $3 billion has been invested in the master plan and its
