          State officials predict California will be home to some 10.8 million
          people aged 60-plus by 2030-nearly a quarter of the state's
          population. This demographic shift will require dramatically increased
          access to affordable housing, health care, and social services.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="p-2 text-justify">
          Recognizing that this demographic change is sure to impact almost
          every aspect of life, governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order
          in 2019 calling for the creation of a plan.

        <p className="p-2 text-justify">
          Relese last year, California's{" "}
          <span className="capitalize">master plan for Aging</span> affirms the
          need for policies that protect the older population and prepare the
          state for a "huge demographic change" according to the California
          Department of Aging (CDA) Director Susan DeMarois.
        </p>
        <p className="p-2 text-justify">
          The <span className="capitalize">master plan for Aging</span>{" "}
          establishes 5 primary goals, including housing for all ages and
          stages, health reimagined, equity and inclusion, caregiving that
          works, and affordable aging.
        </p>
        <p className="p-2 text-justify">
          The plan acknowledges that "affordable aging" is becoming more
          difficult to find. Almost 30% of older Californians currently live in
          poverty, and more than 2 million older adults in California are
          economically insecure.
        </p>
        <p className="p-2 text-justify">
          California's plan proposes more affordable housing units with
          "disability friendly" transportation networks, outdoors and community
          spaces for all ages, and improved emergency responses and
          preparedness.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="p-2 text-justify">
          While efforts to create the plan began prior to the pandemic, the
          onset of COVID-19 emphasized the urgency of developing a plan to
          address aging. In his letter on the Master Plan for Aging, Newsom said
          the outbreak “exposed persistent and systemic inequities” in the
          state, and strained aging and disability services “like never before”.
        </p>
        <p className="p-2 text-justify">
          With this in mind, the governor's plan aims to increase the number of
          caregiver jobs by expanding support for these workers through paid
          family leave, multilingual training, and virtual care options.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="p-2 text-justify">
          About $3 billion has been invested in the master plan and its
          implementation so far, but the total cost of implementation has not
          yet been determined.
        </p>
        <p className="p-2 text-justify">
          According to DeMarois, prior plans to address aging focused narrowly
          on heath care. This version, however, seeks to address the full array
          of challenges and opportunities faced by older adults across the
          state.
        </p>
        <p className="p-2 text-justify">
          "This master plan is very comprehesive", she says, "it looks at the
          whole person."{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="p-2 text-justify">
          Perhaps more importantly, the plan was a universally supported
          endeavor by the Governor, State Legislature and stakeholders, she
          said.
